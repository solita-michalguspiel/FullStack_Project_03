# FullStack_Project_03

## Idea

This repository contains code of my first React.JS app. This application is implemented as an assignment for Full Stack Development course at Laurea.

This project will make use of The Fake News Article API, which was implemented in [FullStack_Project_02](https://github.com/solita-michalguspiel/FullStack_Project_02)
