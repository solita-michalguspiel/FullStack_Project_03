# FullStack_Project_03

## Idea

This repository contains code of my first React.JS app. This application is implemented as an assignment for Full Stack Development course at Laurea.

This project will make use of The Fake News Article API, which was implemented in [FullStack_Project_02](https://github.com/solita-michalguspiel/FullStack_Project_02)

Application serves as a news portal, however there are only fake news on the webiste! Don't believe in anything you read. Users can read news, search for the news, read comments, upvote comments and delete any comment they wish, so don't write anything that someone might want to delete!

## Instructions

In order to run application locally you need to have react on your machine,
afterwards run "npm install" and then "npm start"
